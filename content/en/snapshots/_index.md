The version 1.10 development releases are based on the stable 1.10 release.

The version 1.11 development releases of Workrave are a preview of an upcoming new release of Workrave.
This release has seen a lot of internal cleanup and code modernization, but very few new features.
The most interesting change in version 1.11 is a port to macOS using Qt5. This port is not yet ready.

Note that the version 1.11 did not get as much testing as the official 1.10 release and may be less stable. Please also use it for testing purposes.
