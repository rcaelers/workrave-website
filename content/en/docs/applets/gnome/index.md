title: Gnome applet
---

In the [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) Shell desktop environment, a Workrave applet that shows all timer values can be added to a panel.
This applet can be added by installing both `workrave-gnome` and `gnome-shell-extensions` (details may vary depending on system packaging). Then, in the `Extensions` application page, enable the Workrave extension:

![Enable Gnome Shell applet](/images/screenshots/gnome-shell-applet-activate.png#center)

The Workrave applet will now appear in the system panel.
