# /etc/X11/xorg.conf (xorg X Window System server configuration file)
#
# This file was initially generated by dexconf, the Debian X Configuration tool, using
# values from the debconf database.
#
# Edit this file with caution, and see the /etc/X11/xorg.conf manual page.
# (Type "man /etc/X11/xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)
#
# This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package upgrades *only*
# if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the xserver-xorg
# package.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command:
#   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
# "In Ubuntu Feisty the Composite extension is enabled by default, however,
#  fglrx does not yet support Composite with DRI."
# I believe "composite extension" disables qiv (Luke), so:
#
# In Twinview, the Device section provides the definition for the 2nd mointor.
#
#
# Note that ConnectedMonitor and UseDisplayDevice are mutually exclusive
# options.  And that using UseDisplayDevice seems to *disable* the other
# device so you don't actually get TwinView!
# ---
# The only way I could find to get any part of the taskbar and especially
# the login pane to appear on the DFP was to use NoTwinViewXineramaInfo. :-(
# ---
# Note ESPECIALLY that the order of the MetaModes is the order of
# detection of the screen by the X server, as far as I can see.  Since
# the CRT is detected 1st, you MUST put its mode first in each pair
# or the X server will silently fail to drive the DFP at the given
# resolution.  Actually it's possible that it thinks it *is* driving
# it at that resolution, except the poor old device of course can't
# handle it and displays nothing.
# ---
# Another important tip when using different dimensions on each screen
# (which is what you obviously want to do to get the most out of each screen)
# e.g. LowXxLowY,HiXxHiY is to add an @LowXxHiY to the low resolution in each
# case: e.g. 
# Option      "MetaModes" "1920x1440,1680x1050@1920x1440; 1600x1200@1680x1050,1680x1050"
# Option      "MetaModes" "1920x1440,1680x1050@1680x1440; 1600x1200,1680x1050@1680x1200; 1280x1024,1280x1024; NULL,1680x1050; NULL,1280x1024; NULL,1024x768"
# If you don't do that, then you'll find that the bottom panel is invisible
# on the lower pixel-dimension screen, and if you minimise a window in Metacity
# there is no way for you to reach it with the mouse and re-open it!
# You don't do it with the X dimension though because then you'd introduce
# an apparent gap between the two screens.
