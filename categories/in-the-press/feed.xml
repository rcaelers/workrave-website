&lt;p>Not too long ago, I saw a new kind of mouse that allows you to naturally keep
your hand sideways, like holding the steering wheel of a car. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching
for that, and might consider it in the future as a preventive from repetitive
strain injury (RSI). Workrave ensures you take the necessary breaks to avoid or
help recover from RSI. The two types of breaks are micro-pause (a brief moment
of relaxation) and rest break (a longer break away from the computer). Also, the
program has exercises you can do during your breaks, and they can be done in a
cubicle. View the statistics to see how many breaks you&amp;rsquo;ve taken as well as the
activities such as keystrokes and using the mouse. Take a break after you finish
reading this newsletter. Try closing your eyes or looking at something that is
far away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, congratulations on providing fine resources to the Internet community.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
