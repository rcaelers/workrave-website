&lt;p>Changes since Workrave 1.10.37:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When it is time to take a micro break, Workrave may start a rest break
instead. This happens when the rest break would start within 30 seconds of
the micro break. If the postpone or skip buttons are disabled on the micro
break, they will be temporarily disabled on the rest break window. A small
progress bar indicates how long the buttons are disabled. Previously,
Workrave would restart the micro break when pressing the skip or postpone
button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support applets on Gnome 3.35.1+ using libgnome-panel (Alberts Muktupāvels, &lt;a href="https://github.com/rcaelers/workrave/pull/170">#170&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Fixed focus issue on rest break window that caused muted (grey) text.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Version 1.6.1 is only a minor bug fix release that addresses this problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.6.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2004/04/29/workrave-160-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2004 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2004/04/29/workrave-160-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Windows version of Workrave now includes a taskbar applet version of the
status window. Timers can be configured to ignore activity. Improved full-screen
&amp;ldquo;Block all&amp;rdquo; mode. Chinese, Russian and French translations have been added.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Workrave has been translated into Chinese thanks to Rex Tsai, into Russian
thanks to Sergey Kirkinsky, and into French thanks to Thomas Basset and
Benjamin Siband.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The explanation of an exercise is now scrollable, if it does not fit onscreen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Windows version now includes a taskbar applet version of the status
window. After installation of Workrave, right click your taskbar and select
&amp;ldquo;Workrave&amp;rdquo; from the list of toolbars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Timers can be configured to ignore activity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bloat removal: removed the &amp;ldquo;Resets at&amp;rdquo; option from the daily limit panel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercises are no longer read at program startup, and are released from memory
when not needed anymore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Terminology: we now use the term &amp;ldquo;micro-break&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;micro-pause&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When block mode &amp;ldquo;Block all&amp;rdquo; is used, we display the break window on top of
your current desktop background (wallpaper), instead of on a semi-transparent
screen snapshot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed screen locking on X11: previously only xlock was detected and used
without passing a display parameter. Now, the proper screen lock command is
invoked on the right display. For example, if KDE is detected its
kdesktop_lock is executed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>High-profile bug fixes (Windows): activity monitoring when working in Exceed
has been restored, and ZoneLab interaction problems (hangups) have been
corrected.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.4.1 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2003/11/03/workrave-141-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2003 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2003/11/03/workrave-141-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>The most notable changes in this release are: added a new option &amp;ldquo;Block mode&amp;rdquo;
ranging from no blocking (break windows can be freely dragged around) to full
input and screen blocking, added multihead support for Windows, improved suspend
(to ram) support, added &amp;ldquo;Shut down&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lock&amp;rdquo; buttons to the break windows.
Furthermore, the stability on Windows improved considerably now that several
longstanding issues have been resolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Replaced the &amp;ldquo;Block input&amp;rdquo; setting (which was available per break) by a global
&amp;ldquo;Block mode&amp;rdquo; setting, located in the GUI preferences. The available block
modes are &amp;ldquo;None&amp;rdquo; (NEW: no input is blocked and break windows have a title bar
and can be dragged), &amp;ldquo;Block input&amp;rdquo; (blocks input, break windows are fixed),
&amp;ldquo;Block all&amp;rdquo; (NEW: blocks input and display).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Windows installer now offers the option to install Workrave using the
standalone Dropline GTK+ runtime. For more information, see
&lt;a href="http://www.dropline.net/gtk/">http://www.dropline.net/gtk/&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Removed the &amp;ldquo;Force break after maximum preludes&amp;rdquo; option. It is now on by
default.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some strings in the German translation were too long, fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added multihead support for Windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved suspend (to ram) support. Workrave now assumes that you are idle
while suspended instead of assuming that no time passes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved multihead support. The status window is now automatically relocated
when the monitor on which it is displayed is removed. It moved back to its
original location when the monitor returns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercises navigation can now be used without causing Workrave to remove the
break window and show the warning windows again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If supported by your system, the daily limit window includes a &amp;ldquo;Shut down&amp;rdquo;
button.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There now is a &amp;ldquo;Lock&amp;rdquo; button on the rest break, so that you can safely lock
your display while you are taking breaks. If the daily limit window does not
include the &amp;ldquo;Shut down&amp;rdquo; button, it includes the &amp;ldquo;Lock&amp;rdquo; button instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.4.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2003/08/23/workrave-140-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2003 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2003/08/23/workrave-140-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally, Workrave 1.4.0 is out. The most interesting changes in this version
include: exercises, new translations (Polish, Danish and Spanish), multi-head
support, support for disabling breaks, the content of the status window has been
made configurable, improved (flickerfree) blocking mechanism on Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Added exercises.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workrave has been translated to Polish, Danish and Spanish. Many thanks to
Mikolaj Machowski, Christian Vejlbo, and Pablo Rodriguez!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multihead support for X11. Workrave now shows break windows on all monitors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workrave can now cope with changes in system time and OS features like
suspend-to-ram.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Previously, the end time that showed up in the stats dialog equaled the time
at which the clock reset (typically equal to the start of the next working
day). This lead to weird from/to times, as in: &amp;ldquo;From 8:46 to 9:10&amp;rdquo;. Fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added an icon to the skip/postpone buttons on break windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many laptop pointer devices &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; over time. This used to cause Workrave
to detect activity when there was in fact none. Fixed, thanks to Chung-chieh
Shan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On Windows, Workrave now notices when Explorer crashes and will try to
reinsert the tray icon in the new Explorer taskbar that is created when
Explorer restarts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rewrote the user input blocking mechanism on Windows. You should no longer
experience visual quirks (like flashing windows or unexpectedly focusing
random windows) during breaks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On Linux, Workrave now notices when the gnome-panel crashes and will
reinsert the applet in the new panel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The content of the status window can now be configured.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breaks can now be disabled.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.2.2 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2003/03/24/workrave-122-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2003 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2003/03/24/workrave-122-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Window version now has a native look and feel, so Workrave no longer looks
like a second grade application when running on Windows. Furthermore, support
for Gnome session management was improved: Workrave is now properly restarted by
the Gnome session manager. Finally, the overall user interface has improved,
addressing most HIG issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you stopped working during a prelude just before it was about to
disappear, the prelude would still go away because Workrave assumed you
wanted to continue working. This behaviour has been changed now: if there is
no activity when the count-down has reached zero, Workrave waits a couple of
seconds to see if you are really idle. If that is the case, a break window
appears. If not, you can continue working.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Redesigned the preferences panel. It used to have nested tabs, these have
been replaced with an icon shortcut bar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The break windows have been given a title.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Window version now included GTK-Wimp. This makes the visual appearance
of Workrave blend much better into the Windows desktop environment
(&lt;a href="http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net)">http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better support for Gnome session management. Workrave is now properly
restarted by the gnome session manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The applet can now be configured to show only the Workrave sheep. Clicking
on the sheep will toggle the visibility of the main window.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.2.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2003/03/08/workrave-120-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2003 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2003/03/08/workrave-120-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>The most important new features in this version are statistics and Gnome/KDE
applet support. Workrave now keeps track of all your activity and allows you to
browse through any date in history to see for how long you used the computer,
how many keys you pressed, the distance your mouse moved, and many other
statistical data. Furthermore, when running Workrave on Gnome or KDE, the break
information can be displayed itself in the panel.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Johannes Rohr provided a german translation, thanks!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added applet support. Workrave now supports both a native Gnome applet, as
well as a system tray applet that &lt;em>should&lt;/em> also work on KDE.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added statistics. Workrave shows break statistics and daily usage. More
statistics will be added later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A leaflet promoting Workrave is now available. Please spread it as far as
possible. For example, distribute several copies at the office.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Workrave 1.0.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2002/09/30/workrave-100-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2002 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2002/09/30/workrave-100-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>After extensive testing we finally present our first production release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Version 1.0.0 is rock solid and ready for daily usage at the office. New in this
release is a Dutch translation, and the daily limit window is fully operational
now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workrave 0.1.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2002/09/21/workrave-010-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2002 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2002/09/21/workrave-010-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Workrave 0.1.0 has been released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the first public release. Please note that Workrave is still undergoing
heavy development. Having said that, the current development versions are
already quite usable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workrave 0.2.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2002/09/21/workrave-020-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2002 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2002/09/21/workrave-020-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Version 0.2.0 is here, released soon after 0.1.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lots of bugs have been fixed, and the Windows version now has support for the
system tray.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Workrave 0.3.0 released</title><link>https://workrave.org/2002/09/10/workrave-030-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2002 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Raymond Penners</author><guid>https://workrave.org/2002/09/10/workrave-030-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>Workrave 0.3.0 is here, with sound support and preliminary network support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Added sound support. For office PCs that do not have a sound card, you can
choose to play sounds through the internal PC speaker. Also new, but still
experimental, is distribution support, dubbed &amp;ldquo;The Collective&amp;rdquo;. You can now
create a network of Workrave instances running on several computers. All
instances that are part of the collective share the same timer information,
meaning that if one computer informs you to take a break, it is futile to flee
to another computer as it will also tell you to take a break. Furthermore, some
nasty crashes in the Windows version were fixed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
