The previous website was no longer actively maintained and the content was out of date.
The new site is designed from scratch using &lt;a href="https://www.gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a>.
One major addition compared to the previous website is &lt;a href="https://workrave.org/docs">documentation&lt;/a> for Workrave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please report any issues on the documentation or this website via our &lt;a href="https://github.com/rcaelers/workrave-website/issues">bugtracker&lt;/a> at Github, or &lt;a href="https://workrave.org/contribute-docs">help&lt;/a> us improve this website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who do not remember our previous site:&lt;/p>

Currently, it builds a Debian package,
source tarball, and a Windows installer version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interesting to note is that the Windows version is completely built on a

Patentability rules. Your support is needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proposed revision contains a set of serious challenges to Open Source
development since regulation regarding software patents will be broadly extended
and might forbid independent development of innovative (Open Source and not)
software-based solutions. For further information please see

&lt;p>More progress on Miss Workrave. I have added armatures (bones). Also new is an
office chair, which still needs some nice colors though&amp;hellip;:&lt;/p>

Read on for a
snapshot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent the last few nights moving the site over to my new provider. The site is
finally 100% up and running again. So now I can continue to work on Miss
Workrave. I am currently focusing on her face, here&amp;rsquo;s a first snapshot:&lt;/p>

be nice to inform you about what&amp;rsquo;s cooking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, we were planning on releasing version 1.4.0, with exercises being the
most interesting new feature addition. However, a lot of time went into 3D
modeling of &amp;lsquo;Miss Workrave&amp;rsquo;, who is supposed to instruct you on how to do your
exercises. In fact, a lot of time is still going into that as I speak right now.
Therefore, it is most likely that we&amp;rsquo;ll release an intermediate 1.2.3 in the
near future. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to be a bit more patient for the exercises, but here&amp;rsquo;s
a sneak preview of how &amp;ldquo;Miss Workrave&amp;rdquo; is going to look&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
